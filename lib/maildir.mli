val create : ?init:bool -> string -> t
(** [create init path] returns an object that can be used to access a
    Maildir-directory at [path].  If ?init is [true], then the directory [path]
    and its subdirectories "tmp", "cur", and "new" will be created if they do
    not exist.  The default is [false]. *)
  
val update : t -> unit
(** [update md] updates the cached information to reflect the actual contents of
    the Maildir folder.  This is only needed if more than one program is
    accessing the folder. *)
  
val add : t -> string -> uid
(** [add md data] adds the message with contents [data].  Returns the uid of the
    newly inserted message. *)
  
val get : t -> uid -> string
(** [get md uid] retrieves the filename of the message with uid [uid].

    Raises [Not_found] if no such message is found. *)
  
val remove : t -> uid -> unit
(** [remove md uid] removes the message with uid [uid].

    Raises [Not_found] if no such message is found. *)
  
val set_flags : t -> uid -> flag list -> unit
(** [set_flags md uid flags] changes sets the flags of the message with uid
    [uid] to [flags].

    Raises [Not_found] if no such message is found. *)

val flags : t -> uid -> flag list
(** [flags md uid] returns the list of flags of message with uid [uid].

    Raises [Not_found] if no such message is found. *)

val iter : (msg -> unit) -> t -> unit
(** [iter f md] computes [f msg1; f msg2; ...; f msgN] where [msg1, ..., msgN]
    are the messages in [md] (in some unspecified order). *)

val fold : (msg -> 'a -> 'a) -> t -> 'a -> 'a
(** [fold f md x] computes [(f msg1 (f msg2 (... (f msgN x))))] where [msg1
    ... msgN] are the messages in [md]. *)

val move : t -> t -> msg -> unit
(** [move src dst msg] moves message [msg] from [src] maildir to [dst] *)

val copy : t -> t -> msg -> unit
(** [copy src dst msg] copies message [msg] from [src] maildir to [dst] *)
